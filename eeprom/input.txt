The snow glows white

On the mountain tonight

Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation

And it looks like I'm the Queen

 

The wind is howling

Like this swirling storm inside

Couldn’t keep it in

Heaven knows I tried…

 

Don’t let them in

Don’t let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal

Don’t feel

Don’t let them know…

Well, now they know!

 

Let it go, let it go

Can’t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn away and slam the door!

I don’t care what they’re going to say

Let the storm rage on

The cold never bothered me anyway

 

It’s funny how some distance

Makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me

Can’t get to me at all!

 

It’s time to see

What I can do

To test the limits and break through

No right, no wrong

No rules for me

I’m free!

 

Let it go! Let it go!

I am one with the wind and sky!

Let it go! Let it go!

You’ll never see me cry!

Here I stand and here I’ll stay

Let the storm rage on…

 

My power flurries through the air into the ground

My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

I’m never going back

The past is in the past!

 

Let it go! Let it go!

And I’ll rise like the break of dawn!

Let it go! Let it go!

That perfect girl is gone!

 

Here I stand in the light of day…

Let the storm rage on!!!

The cold never bothered me anyway

REPEAT

The snow glows white

On the mountain tonight

Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation

And it looks like I’m the Queen

 

The wind is howling

Like this swirling storm inside

Couldn’t keep it in

Heaven knows I tried…

 

Don’t let them in

Don’t let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal

Don’t feel

Don’t let them know…

Well, now they know!

 

Let it go, let it go

Can’t hold it back anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn away and slam the door!

I don’t care what they’re going to say
